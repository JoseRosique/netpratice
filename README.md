    This project is designed to help you gain practical experience in configuring small-scale networks and understanding TCP/IP addressing. It consists of 10 levels or exercises that need to be completed and submitted via a Git repository.
  </p>
  <h2>Getting Started:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Download the attached file and extract its contents to a folder of your choice.</li>
    <li>Run the index.html file, which will open a training interface in your web browser.</li>
    <li>The interface will greet you with a message saying "Welcome to NetPractice! :)".</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Interface Overview:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Each level presents a non-functioning network diagram that requires troubleshooting and configuration.</li>
    <li>At the top of the interface, you will find a goal to achieve, which outlines the issues that need to be resolved to make the network run properly.</li>
    <li>There are two buttons available:
      <ul>
        <li>"Check again" allows you to verify whether your configuration is correct or not.</li>
        <li>"Get my config" enables you to download your configuration, which is essential for submitting your assignment.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Successfully completing a level unlocks a new button that leads to the next level.</li>
    <li>Before proceeding to the next level, remember to export your configuration using the "Get my config" button and save it in your Git repository.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Tips and Resources:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Logs are displayed at the bottom of the interface and can provide insights into why your configuration might be incorrect.</li>
    <li>Each exercise requires a thorough understanding of TCP/IP addressing, particularly in networks that involve devices such as routers.</li>
    <li>It is strongly recommended to research and familiarize yourself with TCP/IP addressing concepts to enhance your chances of successfully completing the assignments.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Note: The networks used in this project are not real; they are simulated through the training interface provided.</p>
